## 💁 About

Dhaaga is a passion project I’ve been building over the weekends since 2024.

I wanted to create an SNS app that is: 

* MUST be fun to use and daily drive.
* Efficient by principle and elegant by design.

With the powerful and extensible `@dhaaga/bridge` library at its heart, 
I proudly present Dhaaga as an ergonomic and feature-rich SNS client 
with rich, first-class support for various SNS platforms, as well as unique
client-side features like Social Hub™, Collections™ and Inbox Categories™.

And above all else, after months of effort, I can proudly say that it has 
earned my "fun to use" seal of approval 🙂

I enjoy every hour working on it. And, I'd love to hear about your 
experience using this app, as well! Come say hi~ 🤗

By the way, **'Dhaaga (धागा)'** translates to 'thread' or 'string' in Hindi.
In cultural contexts, it symbolizes representing *connection, continuity, 
and bonds*.
