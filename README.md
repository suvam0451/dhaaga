## 💁 About

Dhaaga is an indie side project I’ve been building in my free time.

Today, there are way too many platforms and servers to choose from.

The exploding landscape of the decentralized social web platforms 
has resulted in userbase fragmentation and diminished
interest/adoption of smaller *(but definitely more fun!)* projects
due to [Metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law).

**The first set of challenges** I am trying to solve are the **protocol
fragmentation** and the **lack of a unified frontend**
for the decentralized social web.

Secondly, with the decline of traditional SNS culture, the social media
experience today has become too *samey*:

*Timelines. Profiles. Likes. Follows. Shares. *You get the idea~**

The discovery and user connection tools are too limited. 
Just lists, search and chat.

For example, for art enthusiasts, maybe Pixiv or Instagram would be a 
better bet. For chatty users, maybe discord would be a better choice.

To better put it, the *presentation model in modern social media does not
adapt to the intent and interests of the individual/community involved. It 
is just too standardized!*

But it does not have to be! **The second set of challenges** I want to solve
are **building better discovery and relationship manager tools**, helping
users put more **personality into their app experience** and
**tweaking the UI presentation model to be user-centric** that boring, 
infinite scrolling timelines.

Welp, that's the plan. Let's see if I deliver on those big words in this
lifetime 🤷‍♂️

By the way, the word **'Dhaaga (धागा)'** means 'thread' or
'string' in Hindi.
It carries deep symbolic significance,
representing *connection, unity and bonding*.
