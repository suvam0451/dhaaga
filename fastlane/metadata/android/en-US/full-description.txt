An Opinionated Fediverse Microblogging App | Put the fun back in Fediverse ü•≥

Dhaaga (Lite Edition) is a beautiful SNS app for the Fediverse,
with a heavy focus on social features, modernized UI/UX,
client-side customisation and offline support.

It offers first-class support for all major
fediverse platforms (Mastodon, Misskey, Pleroma), as well as
most of the active forks (Firefish, Sharkey, Akkoma).

The project's objective is to keep adding/extending features,
in a way that benefits the fediverse microblogging ecosystem as a whole.

Therefore, aiming for 100% feature parity with any single fediverse software is
not a priority.

Innovative features uniquely added in Dhaaga:

‚Ä¢ [v0.1.0] "Timeline Widget", to quickly search and switch to ANY timeline.
‚Ä¢ [v0.2.0] "Bookmark Gallery", to sync, search and view your bookmarks offline.
‚Ä¢ [v0.3.0] "Known Servers", to see info about servers you have previously visited.
‚Ä¢ [v0.4.0] "Profile Gallery", to see your artist friend's work in an art gallery format.
‚Ä¢ ...and I've got more where that came from ‚úåÔ∏è
