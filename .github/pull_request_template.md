### 📝 Dual License Disclaimer

One of my derivatives projects (i.e. - PebbleTalk) benefits from
Dhaaga's bridge framework and is currently not open source.

Therefore, for license compatibility, I can accept incoming 
contributions here under the MIT license only, unfortunately.

I value your time and effort. So, I am obliged to disclose this
and make sure you are comfortable with this arrangement 😄

- [ ] I allow my contributions to be licensed under the MIT license.
