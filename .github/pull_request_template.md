### üìù License

The outgoing licensing terms of the project are as follows:

- [AGPL-v3](./LICENSE) @ `apps/*`
- [MIT](./.github/ALT_LICENSE.md) @ `packages/*`

This project accepts incoming contributions under MIT-compatible 
licenses only.

*(This gives me flexibility and assurance as a dev/publisher,
while keeping the source code available for public benefit.
I would like to one day fully change the license to MIT, when I feel 
I no longer need that assurance.)*

## Pre-Requisites
