### 📝 License Disclaimer

This project accepts contributions under MIT license only.

This lets me add and bundle purchased/licensed art assets outside the 
codebase, while benefitting from sublicensed copyleft protection as an indie 
publisher.

I value your hard work. So, I want to make sure you are okay with this arrangement 😄
