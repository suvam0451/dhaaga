        No need to search for duplicate issues. Just ask away.
        
        #### Considerations
        
        * For instance features, see if it is already implemented.
        * For existing features, the user guide may contain info you may have overlooked
        * We have a priority list for upcoming features in our wiki. See if your feature is already listed there.
