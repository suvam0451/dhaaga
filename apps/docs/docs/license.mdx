## FAQ

**Q. Why do I need to license my contributions code under MIT license?**

A. One of the packages *(dhaagajs)* is expected to be made available to
other fedi developers at a later point of time. And, GPL licenses are not
very common for libraries like that.

However, I would still like to sublicense the entire project under AGPL.
