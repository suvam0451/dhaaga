The Dhaaga project is an indie initiative to build ~~a better~~ THE BEST
microblogging and browsing client for the Fediverse.

## Why build a new app?

The majority of the social apps on fedi are either
Mastodon or Misskey clients.

The largest fediverse software *(Mastodon)* does not support
fun social and microblogging features like reactions and quote tweets.

The second largest fediverse software *(Misskey)* does not have a variety
selection of apps fitting all kinds of users.

The third-largest onwards gets little to no representation in the app
ecosystem and have to manage with whatever is compatible with mastodon's
ActivityPub implementation.

While that's fine, it's a shame that some of the cool features simply do not
work *(or need separate apps and/or PWAs on phone)*:

- *[Misskey]* Antennas, Galleries
- *[Pleroma]* Sticker Reactions
- *[Akkoma]* Bubble Timelines
- *[Sharkey]* Federated Background and Music statuses

> Dhaaga aims to fill this gap by **unifying the end-user experience** while
> **celebrating the uniqueness** of the fedi software ecosystem.

## Why build it for mobile?

Building for native platform gives me a lot more tools to work with.
to help solve common pain points of fedi users.

## Dhaaga is Open Source

The Dhaaga project is open source.

This means that the source code is available to everybody
and licensed under the AGPL license.

This means that, everybody has the freedom to inspect, modify and create their
own customized version of Dhaaga and distribute it.

This also makes it easy for other people to make/request contributions
to the project and there is less chance of malicious code/intent being
injected into your app.

:::info

The source code for the apps *(as well as this website)* is hosted
on [GitHub](https://github.com/suvam0451/dhaaga)

## What are the project goals?

- Build ~~a better~~ THE BEST microblogging app on fedi
- Build

	- Superior one-handed mode

### Big plans! How will Dhaaga achieve all this?

I have no roadmap. I have no end date. I just have a simple plan:

1. Pick a feature *(Existing or New)*
2. Make it work
3. Make it work well (Intuitive, Beautiful and Functional)
4. Make it work for every platform
5. Ship it and get feedback

## See You

I have plenty of motivation. Your support is all I need.

Please consider using Dhaaga and telling your friends about it,<br/>Deb üôè
