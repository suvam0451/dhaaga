A timeline is the second-most interacted UI component for a fedi user.

Admittedly, I cannot achieve the same levels of interactivity built through
years of dedication from a passionate community
*(That misskey.io local timeline... sheesh...)*

But, I can do my best to present it in a way that is intuitive and gives the
user more options.

Here are some ways in which Dhaaga makes your timeline experience better.

## Timeline Switcherâ„¢

### What does it solve?

Discoverability in fediverse is a pain. While accessing Home/Local timelines is
well supported, jumping between other types of timelines (remote,
hashtags, users) is not that simple.

It is general practice to "pin" your favourite timelines for easy access.

### Pitch ðŸ˜Ž

Jump to whatever the heck timeline I feel like, from a single search prompt.

### How

Enter Timeline Switcherâ„¢ by Dhaaga.

When in the Home screen, you can select the "Timeline Switcher"

- By clicking the second FAB menu module
- Or, clicking the little arrow beside the timeline label

### How does it work

When you call the switcher, you have five tabs.

1. \[First Page\] Your usual timelines (`Home`, `Local`, `Publi`).
    1. If you are using compatible software, you will also see `Social`
       and `Bubble` timelines as option.
2. \[Second Page\] Your lists
    1. If you are using misskey forks, your antennas will appear here
3. \[Third Page\] Hashtags
    1. Type and jump to any hashtag
    2. \[TODO\] If you are following a hashtag, it will also appear as search
       result

### About

This feature was inspired by a similar workflow in Apollo Client (Reddit App)
