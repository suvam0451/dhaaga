## FAQ

**Q. Why would an app need an entire usage manual? should it all not be
intuitive out of the box? ðŸ˜…**

A. A finished product, yes. But, Dhaaga is FOSS and is built
transparently and taking in community feedback.

Even after writing tens of
thousands of lines of code over a span of couple months,
I am nowhere near done making it a decent experience for the average user.

Also, this is my first time building an app. So, some of the designs might
feel like having been built by a backend guy on shrooms on a chilly night.ðŸ« 

A few moment of your time is all I ask.

Suggestions, Feedbacks, Criticism are all welcome ðŸ«¶.

**Q. Too many walls of text ðŸ˜­**

A. Plan on revisiting and simplifying sections as I make the in-app workflows
simpler and more intuitive ðŸ¥¹
