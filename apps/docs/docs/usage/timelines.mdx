With some exceptions, you want to be in the first (Home) tab to view all
your timelines.

Dhaaga is a single column client, with nifty tools to switch between them
effortlessly.

### The "Social Hub"

This is your entrypoint and AFK lobby in the home tab.

Whenever you switch your account, your home page is reset to this.

It is pretty barebones for a home page at the moment ðŸ˜”

:::info

In the future, this page will contain all your pinned timeline destinations,
notification summary and
and let you "continue where you left off"

### Accessing Timelines

You either select a destination from your Social Hub or switch between
timelines using the Timeline Switcher.

The timeline switcher can be accessed from the marked locations.

	alt={"Timeline Switcher Access Locations"}
	width={240}
	align={"center"}
/>

To see the destinations available and planned for you from the Timeline
Switcher, see the corresponding section.

### Setting Timeline Options

Most filters available via your web dashboard is also available at the top
of every timeline.

I even added a little description for the confused folks new to fediverse. ðŸ˜‰

### Navigating

That's it. You just scroll down. More posts load automatically.

I don't have anything else exciting to share at the moment (but maybe, maybe
soonish~).



:::warning

Depending on your phone, Loading more than 100 or so posts might actually
cause performance issues and hangs.

While I have creative solutions planned for this, I haven't gotten around to
implementing them yet.

## FAQ

**Q. What's with loading only 5 posts? Every other client loads like 20 at a
time.**

A. React Native is the slowest of the app dev trinity (Native/Flutter/RN).
So, I have to evaluate performance/time impact before I change the limits.
Also, most other clients are just timeline readers, which I am not a
fan of.

Here is what Dhaaga has to do for every set of items loaded:

- Parse and render the markdown
- Make each component (hashtag/mentions/links) interactable via bottom sheets
- Resolve the custom emojis for those instances
- Load the replies/parent of a post, if missing
- Highlight hashtags you are following
- Establish your relationship with the users and
- Unify the experience between software
- e.g. - bookmark status has to be loaded via an extra API call in Misskey
forks, whereas, in Dhaaga it's all just one UI

td;dr - Dhaaga focuses on the quality of your SNS interaction than volume of
posts.
