### Important

Every SVG in this folder can be used for personal/commercial scenarios with 
an attribution.

For use without attribution, get a subscription and download the 
licenses for listed assets from Flaticons *(like me)*.

Since SVGs are just lines of code, I have included them in the codebase for 
easier development.

### Other Notes

The image assets *(e.g. - backdrops, wallpapers etc.)* are not part of the 
code. They are conditionally included at bundle time and are only available 
in my local machine.
