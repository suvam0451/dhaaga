#2 -- In addition, the [developer](https://github.com/suvam0451) reserves the
right to use project specific
names and branding, when it comes to distributing the app in
binary form across any kind of online store (Google/Apple/Linux-Packages/NPM)

^ i.e - If you are forking/building the project, **with any intent of
distribution via online stores/servers**,
it is a humble request from me, that you use a **different, clearly
distinguishable name and branding** for it.

^ This is not applicable for personal use and/or P2P sharing. Only distribution
over online stores.

NOTE: The AGPLv3 licensing rules still apply.

## Request for Forks/Users Intending (Re)Distribution of Binaries

The following request is applicable,
only if you are **forking this project (regardless of changes made)
with intent of distribution,
or directly participating in (without forking) redistribution of the app,
in binary format, over any kind of online store/server**,
including but not limited to:

- Google Play Store
- Apple AppNavBar Store
- Linux package managers like AUR/NPM/DNF
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- FOSS AppNavBar Repositories (F-Droid)
- Self-Hosted Download Links or apk sharing platforms (ApkPure, ApkMirror etc.)

**NOTICE:**

While this project is licensed under the AGPLv3,
I kindly request that any forks or redistributions
of this project, which intend to distribute the app in binary format
over online stores,
to use a clearly distinguishable name and branding that separates
their offering from this project.

This will help avoid confusion among end users and
ensure that the integrity of the original project is maintained.

The developer of this project offers complementary support and software services
over the network, in exchange for a small fee.
Redistributing, under a similar name runs the risk of end users getting stuck in
outdated/unsupported version of software and/or receiving malicious code.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

## FAQ

**Q. I have never seen this kind of request in any other open source project ðŸ¤¨.
**

It is general courtesy in open-source world to do so.
Expressing my intentions in writing helps me sleep better at night ðŸ˜†

Some Examples:

- [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android) -> [Megalodon](https://github.com/sk22/megalodon) -> [Moshidon](https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon)
- [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) -> [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey) -> [Firefish](https://firefish.dev/firefish/firefish) -> [IceShrimp](https://iceshrimp.dev/iceshrimp/iceshrimp)

**Q. Asking people to rename their fork of the project is too much. Does this
mean the project discourages/burdens contributors?**

Not at all! If your intention is not to distribution over app stores, then you
need not worry.

All contributions are welcome and very much appreciated <3

In fact, if you would like to collaborate on the project,
you just need to ask! (translators and artists, especially)

**Q. Is this request even compatible with a FOSS license like AGPLv3?**

Yep. [Reference](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#packaging)

Rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable,
if they don't substantively limit your freedom to release modified versions,
or your freedom to make and use modified versions privately.

**Q. Does this request discourage other people from making money from the
project?**

Not at
all! [Reference](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#redistribute)

Freedom to distribute (freedoms 2 and 3) means you are free to redistribute
copies,
either with or without modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for
distribution,
to anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means (among other things)
that you do not have to ask or pay for permission to do so.
